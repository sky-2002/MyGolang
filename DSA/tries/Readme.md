# Implementing a text search using trie data structure.<br>
1. A trie is a tree like data structure in which all children of a node have a common prefix.<br>
2. Looking up data in a trie is fast. O(m) is the worst case complexity when length of search string is m.<br>

Below is a pictorial representation of how we will implement a text search.<br>
